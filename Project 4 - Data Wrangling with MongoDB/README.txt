Data Wrangling with MongoDB -- Open Street Map
-------------------
This project is about wrangling and analysing map data freely available at Open Street Map. Below are the steps followed.

1. Select an area of interest(Hermosa beach, California, USA) and download the map data using Overpass API.
2. Map data will be downloaded as XML. Make sure the downloaded XML file is at least of 50 MB.
3. Get basic understanding about the data.
4. Audit data items and remove/clean data elements.
5. Once data set is clean convert the dataset into an array of dictionaries according to the data model provided earlier during the course. The data model was built to load the data items into MongoDB.
6. Once data items are correctly converted dump them into a JSON document that will be imported into a mongodb collection.
7. Once JSON documents are loaded into MongoDB gather basic statistics about the collection.
8. Do a series of analysis on the data using Python driver for MongoDB.
9. Describe the challenges faced in this project.
10. Other ideas about the dataset.
